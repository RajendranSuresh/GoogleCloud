## Description
This project automates the configuration of an internal Network Load Balancer in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The setup creates managed instance groups and configures private load balancing for TCP/UDP traffic accessible only to internal VM instances.

## Lab Objectives
- Create two managed instance groups in the same region
- Configure internal Network Load Balancing
- Set up health checks and backend services
- Test internal load balancing functionality
