### Detect Manufacturing Defects using Visual Inspection AI: Challenge Lab




# Challenge Lab Overview  

Test your Google Cloud skills in a real-world scenario! This challenge lab presents tasks without step-by-step instructions‚Äîapply what you've learned to solve problems independently.  

# Challenge: Defect Detection Deployment  

**Objective**:  
Deploy and test a solution that accurately classifies mobile phones as:  
‚úÖ **Non-defective** (no cosmetic defects)  
‚ùå **Defective** (with cosmetic defects)  

**Success Criteria**:  
- Artifact deployed correctly.  
- System identifies **both** defect types with valid results.  

**Tips**:  
- Validate input/output formats.  
- Check error logs if classifications fail.
